# CommandLineBlackjack

Near the end of 2019 I began Game Development and Design. 
As suggested by so many on YouTube I began my journey using Unity. 

Using Unity for the first time really prompted me to learn C#, The best way to
learn is by doing so this project is my First C# Program and is what will guide me to C# Mastery
However messy or incomplete it may be at the moment.
